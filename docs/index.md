# Robot Guides

This repository contains the documentation for the robots we have in the lab.

These guides were written by Toby Godfrey (t.godfrey ~at~ soton.ac.uk). If there are errors or omissions, please inform me as soon as possible.

**If you have encountered an issue with a robot, please inform us immediately by completing this form <https://forms.office.com/e/gP7mZcBhfr>. Please complete the form even if the robot has recovered.**

## General Information

- Do not store your working files on the robots; robot storage will be wiped on a regular basis.
- Major changes to robot software or configuration should not be conducted unless it has been discussed and approved by an experienced user. If you need to discuss such a change please email Toby Godfrey (t.godfrey ~at~ soton.ac.uk).
- If you wish to contribute a guide for a specific robot type please submit a PR on the [GitHub](https://github.com/sooratilab/robotguides/).
- This is not a guide on ROS! The purpose of these documents is to allow users to easily utilise the robotic platforms that we have in the lab.
