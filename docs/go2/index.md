# Go2

This directory contains the documentation for the Go2 platform.

We currently have three Go2 platforms in the lab. At the time of writing only one has been set up.

If you have not used the Go2s before, please see [Getting Started](getting_started.md).

For all other information about the Go2s, please navigate to the relevant page.
