# Robot Guides

This repository contains the documentation for the robots we have in the lab.

!!!question "Are you lost?"
    This website outlines the operating proceedures for the robots we have in the lab at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-sciencek). (This documentation may be useful to others.) For the main lab website, please click [here](https://sooratilab.com).

These guides were written by Toby Godfrey (t.godfrey ~at~ soton.ac.uk). If there are errors or omissions, please inform me as soon as possible.

**If you have encountered an issue with a robot, please inform us immediately by completing this form <https://forms.office.com/e/gP7mZcBhfr>. Please complete the form even if the robot has recovered.**

!!!warning "Non-Linux Systems"
    This guide was written for Linux systems. If you are using a different OS, some of this information may not work for you (mainly the code segments). If you overcome such issues, please submit a PR on [GitHub](https://github.com/sooratilab/robotguides/) to make these guides more comprehensive.

## General Information

- Do not store your working files on the robots; robot storage will be wiped on a regular basis.
- Major changes to robot software or configuration should not be conducted unless it has been discussed and approved by an experienced user. If you need to discuss such a change please email Toby Godfrey (t.godfrey ~at~ soton.ac.uk).
- If you wish to contribute a guide for a specific robot type please submit a PR on the [GitHub](https://github.com/sooratilab/robotguides/).
- This is not a guide on ROS! The purpose of these documents is to allow users to easily utilise the robotic platforms that we have in the lab. (For help with ROS and other robotics ideas take a look [here](https://automaticaddison.com/tutorials/).)
